Project Summary
This project focuses on creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The process involves several key phases:
1. Model Training:
The CNN is trained using a dataset that comprises:
•	4000 dog images
•	4000 cat images
2. Model Evaluation:
Once the training phase is complete, the model’s performance is tested on a separate evaluation dataset, which contains:
•	1000 dog images
•	1000 cat images
3. Prediction Deployment:
After achieving sufficient accuracy, the trained CNN will be employed to classify fresh images stored in the single_prediction folder into either the "dog" or "cat" category.

Tools and Technologies
This project utilizes TensorFlow along with its high-level API, Keras, to build and train the CNN. TensorFlow acts as the computational backbone, supporting both CPU and GPU operations, while Keras simplifies the process of designing and fine-tuning neural network architectures.
Why Choose TensorFlow and Keras?
•	TensorFlow: A scalable, high-performance framework for building machine learning and deep learning models. It efficiently supports hardware acceleration for quicker computation.
•	Keras: A user-friendly API built for simplicity, enabling easier creation and experimentation with neural networks. Its integration into TensorFlow provides seamless access to powerful features without compromising code simplicity.

Step-by-Step Approach
1.	Data Preparation:
o	Arrange the dataset into well-structured directories for training and testing purposes.
o	Apply preprocessing techniques like image normalization (scaling pixel values) and data augmentation (random transformations) to enhance model accuracy and reduce overfitting.
2.	CNN Model Construction:
o	Design the CNN using TensorFlow/Keras by stacking layers such as:
	Convolutional layers for feature extraction
	Pooling layers for dimensionality reduction
	Fully connected layers for final classification
3.	Model Training:
o	Train the network using the prepared training dataset.
o	Monitor progress through metrics such as loss and accuracy to evaluate performance.
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to measure its generalization ability.
5.	Predictions on New Images:
o	Utilize the model to classify images stored in the single_prediction directory as either dogs or cats.
